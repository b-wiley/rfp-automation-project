# RFP Automation Project

At Census, prospective customers typically like to kick off the technical and commercial evaluation process by creating an Excel sheet full of requirements, to better guage which vendors are going to be a good fit, prior to actually talking to them. This is very common.  It is our jobs as Solutions Engineers and Account Executives to go through each requirement and provide a response to each requirement.  As a team, we manually go through each requirement by explaining whether or not we can meet a requirement, as well as some additional information about how we meet the requirement.

### What is an RFP?
For context, an RFP (Request for Proposal) is a formal document issued by an organization to solicit proposals from qualified vendors for a specific product or service. It outlines the project's requirements, goals, and the organization's needs, enabling potential vendors to understand the scope of work and submit proposals that best meet the organization's objectives. This competitive process helps organizations find the most suitable solution by allowing them to compare proposals from various vendors based on factors like price, experience, and proposed solutions.

### Why automate this process?
I have personally worked on RFPs that have been up to 500 requirements.  This means that as a team, we will collectively spend days and weeks thoroughly going through the document to ensure we're putting our best foot forward as a company, while being fully transparent with what we can and cannot support.  Every RFP we complete is another manual task that we complete, which becomes very repetitive as our answers rarely change.  (Answers only change when the product or commercial terms change).

This means that there is a glaring opportunity for us to save countless hours by automating this process and Generative AI is the perfect solution!  There are plenty of SaaS tools out there that do this themselves, but this is simple enough of a feature that I believe is worth automating in-house.
